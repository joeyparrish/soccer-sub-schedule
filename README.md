# Soccer Substitution Scheduler

This is a very simple, very dumb web tool I'm using for my kid's soccer team to
coordinate with our other coach on how and when we plan our subs during a game.

Please don't expect much.  This was hacked together in an evening, and I'm not
going to treat it with any real seriousness.  It's not well-commented, it's not
built for long-term maintenance.  It's an ad-hoc tool for a kid's soccer team.

I wouldn't even have made this repo public, except that I needed to publish the
thing on github.io.
